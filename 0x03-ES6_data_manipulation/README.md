# 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and focuses on mastering ES6 data manipulation techniques in JavaScript. It covers various tasks, each aimed at honing specific skills related to array manipulation, typed arrays, and working with data structures like Set and Map.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Basic List of Objects**: Implement a function to return an array of objects representing students with their IDs, first names, and locations.
2. **More Mapping**: Create a function to extract student IDs from the list of objects.
3. **Filter**: Implement a function to filter students based on their location.
4. **Reduce**: Calculate the sum of student IDs using the reduce function.
5. **Typed Arrays**: Create a function to manipulate Typed Arrays.
6. **Set Data Structure**: Implement a function to create a Set from an array.
7. **More Set Data Structure**: Create a function to check if all elements of an array exist in a Set.
8. **Clean Set**: Implement a function to filter and format Set values based on a given prefix.
9. **Map Data Structure**: Generate a Map of groceries with quantities.
10. **More Map Data Structure**: Update the quantities of unique items in a Map.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the GitHub repository: [alx-backend-javascript/0x03-ES6_data_manipulation](https://github.com/alx-backend-javascript/0x03-ES6_data_manipulation)
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Implement each task as described in the task description files (e.g., `0-get_list_students.js`, `1-get_list_student_ids.js`, etc.).
5. Test each function using `npm run test`.
6. Ensure all code passes linting checks using ESLint (`npm run lint`).
7. Verify the entire project using `npm run full-test`.

Feel free to explore each task individually, implement the required functions, and test your solutions against the provided test cases. Happy coding!
