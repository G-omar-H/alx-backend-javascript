# Project: 0x01. ES6 Promises

## Overview
This project focuses on mastering ES6 Promises in JavaScript, covering essential concepts such as resolving promises, error handling, utilizing `then` and `catch`, and working with asynchronous functions using `async` and `await`.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of Promises: how, why, and what
- Utilize `then`, `resolve`, and `catch` methods effectively
- Implement `Promise` object methods like `every` for advanced functionality
- Handle errors using `throw`, `try`, and `catch`
- Leverage the power of the `await` operator for asynchronous programming
- Implement and use `async` functions for cleaner asynchronous code

## Project Tasks
1. Implement basic Promise creation
2. Handle Promise resolution based on a boolean value
3. Add handlers to deal with resolved and rejected Promises
4. Handle multiple successful promises concurrently
5. Create a simple Promise for signing up users
6. Reject a Promise with a custom error message
7. Handle multiple Promises concurrently and log the fastest response
8. Implement error handling with `try` and `catch`
9. Handle errors and add guardrails to a function
10. Implement `async` functions and use `await` to handle asynchronous tasks

## Setup
- NodeJS 12.11.x
- Jest, Babel, ESLint for testing and linting
- Configuration files: `package.json`, `babel.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js`
- Additional utility functions provided in `utils.js`

## Response Data Format
- `uploadPhoto` function returns a response object with `status` and `body` attributes
- `createUser` function returns a response object with `firstName` and `lastName` attributes

## Usage
- Clone the repository from [alx-backend-javascript/0x01-ES6_promise](https://github.com/G-omar-H/alx-backend-javascript.git)
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run tests with `npm run test`
- Lint code with `npm run lint`
